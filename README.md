## Project Two
### Background
> A rotor-bearing testbed was built to analyze the health condition of the shaft with unbalance defects.   
### Introdution
> Develop a program assessing the health condition of the shaft based on provided vibration data.  
> The submission should contain: 
> 1. A brief introduction of the analytics process.
> 2. Figures or tables showing the assessment result.
> 3. All the programming codes.  

## Project Three
### Introduction
> Problem Statement 
>> Use SOM, SOM-MQE for health assessment on the data set from the shaft testbed.

## Project Three
### Introduction
